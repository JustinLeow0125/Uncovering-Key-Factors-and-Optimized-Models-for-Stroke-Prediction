# Uncovering Key Factors and Optimized Models 
for Stroke Prediction: An Exploratory and 
Comparative Analysis 
 Stroke remains to be a significant global health 
issue, ranking as one of the leading causes of death and long
term disability. Early detection and prevention are now crucial 
due to the rising burden of chronic diseases and incidence of 
strokes brought on by ageing populations. Thus, this study 
investigates the application of advanced Machine Learning 
techniques such as Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) to create predictive models that can accurately 
estimate the probability of stroke risk and identify important 
contributing factors. The study makes use of a stroke prediction 
dataset from Kaggle, which includes various variables: age, 
gender, medical history and lifestyle factors. After examining 
the performance, scalability and interpretability of the two 
models, it is found that age, hypertension and heart disease are 
significant predictors. Although both models achieved high 
accuracy and ROC-AUC scores, XGBoost outperformed 
Logistic Regression in modelling non-linear relationships and 
addressing class imbalances. However, the difficulties of dealing 
with unbalanced datasets are highlighted by the low sensitivity 
of both models to stroke cases. To increase the detection of 
minority class instances, improvements such as cost-sensitive 
learning or oversampling techniques are recommended. 
Nonetheless, the findings offer valuable insights for healthcare 
providers and policymakers, highlighting the need for targeted 
public health initiatives and preventive measures. By utilizing 
the capabilities of Machine Learning, this study advances stroke 
risk prediction and prevention efforts. Ultimately, this improves 
patient care and raises the quality of healthcare systems.
